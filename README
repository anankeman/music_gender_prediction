The code is in a Jupyter Notebook that it is divided in two parts that can be run independently.
The dependencies are:
-Pandas, 
-numpy, 
-matplotlib, 
-sklearn
-imblearn

The first is the analysis part that leaded to build the final model and contains comments of the
 research process documented in the final paper, as other metrics.

The second has the final train, predict and evaluate function requested in the specs.
They uses as arguments the dataset provided in the specs to develop the model.



train(train dataset, test dataset, train labels, test labels, random seed (default to 0)) 
Returns a trained model and a transformed testing dataset.

predict(model, test dataset transformed)
Returns a list with predicted labels

evaluate(prediction list, test labels)
Returns a classification report includin Acuracy, presicion, recall and f1- scores for each class.
